Three remarks from Chris Netherton (by e-mail, 28/02/24):
- "I think the original RDP4 conclusion that the Russian genome MW306192 was a recombinant is incorrect. IIRC there was a single bp difference between this virus and some of the others"
- "I’m a bit confused about the location of the Latvian virus, there is a location given but I couldn’t work out exactly where in Latvia the location referred to"
- "we also kicked out a Ukrainian isolate for lacking a date and this has now been added"
